Let's get moving! Introducing the [SparkFun 6DoF - LSM6DSV16X (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21325) and the [SparkFun Micro 6DoF - LSM6DSV16X (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21336) - two Qwiic enabled boards based on the LSM6DSV16X from STMicroelectronics. This little chip is a high-performance, low-power 6-axis IMU, featuring a 3-axis digital accelerometer and a 3-axis digital gyroscope, with a triple core for processing acceleration and angular rate data on three separate channels (user interface, OIS, and EIS) with dedicated configuration, processing, and filtering. 

The triple core enables processes in edge computing, leveraging embedded advanced dedicated features such as a finite state machine for configurable motion tracking and a machine learning core for contextual awareness with exportable AI features for IoT applications. Qvar(electric charge variation detection) is embedded for user interface functions like tap, double tap, triple tap, long press, or L/R â€“ R/L swipe.
